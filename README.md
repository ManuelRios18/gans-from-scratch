# Generative Adversarial Networks

This repository holds barebones implementations of different GAN architectures. 
Each python file is self-contained and were created aiming to replicate (to the best of our knowledge) the original algorithms proposed by Goodfellow et al.
This repository was created for educational purposes, therefore, many training parameters are hard coded. 

# Usage 

Simply install the requirements `pip install requirements.txt` and then execute any file you want to try `python gan.py`.
